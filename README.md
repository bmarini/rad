# RESTful API Documenter

Generate beautiful documentation for your restful API.

## WARNING - This is under development, not ready for anything

## Goals

* Create a DSL for API documentation
* Not get in the way when you need to customize

## Credits

The resulting generated API is pretty much a rewrite of [Wordnik's awesome documentation](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs)
